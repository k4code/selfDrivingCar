  Start by watching this animated video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEy91PGGLR0 by Thomas Schwenke , his video explains much needed information about self driving cars.
  
His animation explains the basic operation of self-driving vehicles.

Contents:

1) Sensors (radar, camera, LIDAR, ultrasonic) 
2) LIDAR as a key component (with lightrays) 
3) Cameras for obstacle and lane recognition 
4) GPS and digital maps 
5) Odometric data and sensors 
6) Processors (chips) for data fusion

After finishing the above video read the article [How Does a Self-Driving Car See?](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2019/04/15/how-does-a-self-driving-car-see/)

#optional#

If your have little more stamina left in your body do read [Self driving cars: From A to Z(Module 1) â€” 1 (Computer vision fundamentals) ](https://medium.com/autonomous-machines/self-driving-cars-from-a-to-z-module-1-1-91d7f3cd5ac4)

=======It should be perfectly normal for you to not understand the computer visions fundamentals the first time you read it. But try to make atleast 10-40% sense out of the text you read=======.

Dont worry if it bounced over your brain, because we are going to cover all the computer vision related topic needed in this Self
 Driving Car course.
